Scrape ETF holdings to discover the actual composition of your portfolio (given it contains ETFs).

## to do
- Add functions to scrape data from different ETF managers. If some cases a download link is available. In other cases, such as Vanguard, holdings data needs to be scraped from paginated HTML.
- Write scraped data to remote database
- Add API to return holdings data from database
- Host on Heroku
